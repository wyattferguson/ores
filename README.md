# :joystick: Ores

A remake of the classic flash game ores with Pyxels.

# Installation & How To Use

Installation is pretty straight forward, Im using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) to manage everything.

First if you dont Poetry installed run this:

```
pipx install poetry
```

Then install the dependencies with:

```
poetry install
```

To run it simply:

```
poetry run python ./ores/ores.py

```
